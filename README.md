## Summary
The following is a bare-bones-sinatra-skeleton I created to help assist me when making CRUD apps. The example has users and resources. A user has many resources.

In this branch you will find:

* Full CRUD for resources
* Create and Read for User
* Full authentication (login / logout)
* Full authorization (locking down the front end and back end)
* Error handling
